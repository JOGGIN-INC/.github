# The Furious Frequency Fanatics

Welcome to the Good Music, Heavy Basslines, Disgusting Lines of Code and Overall Angriness organization on GitHub!

We are a group of music lovers, coders, and overall angry individuals who are dedicated to creating and sharing content that reflects our passion for all things heavy, bass-driven, and downright nasty.

Whether you're into writing code that makes your colleagues cringe, or just want to jam out to some seriously heavy beats, you'll find something to love within our organization.

So come on in, join the party, and let's make some noise (and a few enemies along the way)!
